# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

Project Idea: 
Create a NFT DAO.

Use Case:
- A deadline is established for members of the DAO to stake ETH.
- If the threshold ETH amount is not collected by the deadline, members will be allowed to withdraw funds that they put in.
- If a certain threshold value of ETH is reached by the deadline, staking will be considered complete and the full balance of ETH is sent to a "safe".
- Members will be allowed to propse purchasing a NFT (from OpenSea for example).
- If consensus is reached, the purchase is made.
- The DAO will have the option to sell the NFT and then distribute the proceeds of the sale back to the members.
